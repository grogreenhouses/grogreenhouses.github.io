### Our greenhouses are compact and modular in design. With successful usage, consumers will have access to year-round growth and 30% reduced growing time, resulting in a 300% increase in crop yields, enabling a Return on Investment within 6 months. Additional benefits of our greenhouses include climate control siding, insect mesh and a drip irrigation system which helps reduce water waste. Because GRO utilizes locally sourced materials for all but our drip irrigation system and our glazing, we are able to keep our costs lower than the competition- commercial greenhouses. 

#### **Durability:** Average lifespan of 5+ years
