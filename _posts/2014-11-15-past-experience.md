### Our technology has been implemented in East and West Africa. In 2012, we licensed our design to Mavuuno Greenhouses in East Africa, where all 65 are fully operational today. Because of this success, we expanded to Cameroon, licensing our technology to The Greenhouse Center, where operations are completely self-sustaining. Next we entered Sierra Leone and partnered with World Hope International, an NGO with years of experience in the context. Since we have received a $500,000 grant from USAID to fuel our expansion into Mozambique.  With the demand for our greenhouses validated, and their effectiveness tested, GRO greenhouses is a practical instrument for combating household food insecurity in developing communities around the world.
